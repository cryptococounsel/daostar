# Contributing to DAOstar

First off, thanks for offering to contribute! DAOstar is a big open source project. It would not be possible without the help of contributors from across the ecosystem. 

That said, the project maintainers have limited bandwidth to help onboard everyone, so we've written this document to help guide people who are interested in getting involved.

## Getting started

1. Learn more about DAOs before you start contributing. Take a look at some of the resources at daoscience.org.
2. Come to a community call.
3. If you are already comfortable with contributing to OSS projects, look at our current issues and message us there. We try to keep good documentation of issues. 
4. We do have funding for specific roles and projects in DAOstar but we try to prioritize existing open source contributors.
5. Consider writing your own standard. You don't need permission. Just post it on the discussion forum!
