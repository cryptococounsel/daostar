We recommend that all users follow these key security practices:
- **Keep Software Up-to-Date**: Regularly update your DAOstar components to the latest version to ensure you have the most recent security patches.
- **Use Strong Authentication**: Implement strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible.
- **Secure Configurations**: Follow our secure configuration guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor and Audit**: Regularly monitor your systems for suspicious activity and perform routine audits to ensure ongoing security.
